### Project: Factors of Seed Count

The rendered "final draft" is [here](https://stephanie-t-nguyen.github.io/ENVS-193DS-final-project/code/final_project_code.html).

Contains code for the final project where a data set from  Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass
and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico (2001) were used to answer the question: How does total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations? The dataset comes from this the EDI data portal: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-sev.208.102459. This question was considered problem 1. Another data set used was from Individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator
visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge, 2019 - 2021 in order to answer the question: How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? The dataset comes from this EDI data portal: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-nwt.297.1

### Files Overview

### Methods and Results 

The data file stores the dataset where the data comes from and the code folder stores the code for the homework including code for the visualizations and tests we ran. For problem 1, we created linear models to see if different Kangaroo mound locations can predict seed total seed number. For problem 2, we created generalized linear models.
