# Scratch paper 



## Problem two 

Questions: How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total
number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it? 

```{r}

#Load in Problem 2 data
pollinator <- here("data", "shrubstudy_pollinator.ms.data.csv") |> 
  read.csv()

seed_ctwt <- here("data", "shrubstudy_seed_ctwt.ms.data.csv") |> 
  read.csv()

individual_flower <- here("data", "shrubstudy_individual_flower_counts.ms.data.csv") |> 
  read.csv()

community_flower <- here("data", "shrubstudy_community_flower_counts.ms.data.csv") |> 
  read.csv()
```
