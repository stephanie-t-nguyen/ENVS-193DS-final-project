### Notes \[DELETE LATER\]

Problem #1: How does total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations?

Summary of context article (The Composition of seed banks) Rat mound creates micro-environments that can effect seed banks or number of seeds, studies tend to show that there are more seeds around mounds

-   probably do a single linear regression like in homework 4? Have to use Kruskel test instead of ANOVA because data is non-normal

Data Dictionary:

-   mnd: kangaroo rat mound (location)

-   dir: direction from center of the mound

-   loc: microhabitat (B = base, S = surrounding, E = edge, I = interspace)

-   species: four letter code for target taxa

-   seeds: seed counts for species and percent cover for physical variables

Problem #2: How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it?

-   probably do a multiple linear regression like in homework 5? --actually we CAN"T because the data is not normal

Summary: Because of climate change "shrubfication is happening in the tundra, where more shrubs are growing in the tundra, which would effect the ecosystem there. On average, there are more flowers in open plots vs shrub plots. Shrub plots are plots that have undergone shrubfication. Open plots have not experienced shrubfication yet.

# Introduction

Kangaroo rats build mounds that create micro-environments and foster more plant diversity than adjacent grassland [@guo1996]. Even within the same mound, there are different microhabitats depending on distance away from the mound [@koontz2010]. Using data from "Effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds," our study investigates how total seed number differs between kangaroo rat mound locations (base of the mound, surrounding areas, edge of mound, and interspace between mound and grassland) [@koontz2013]. Our null hypothesis states that there is no difference in number of seeds between the different kangaroo rat mound locations. Our alternative hypothesis states that some locations of the mound support more seeds than others.

The data was cleaned by...(Figure 1) no missing data

An exploratory data visualization was creating plotting the number of seeds at each of the four mound locations (Figure 2). At a glance, it appears that the closer the location to the mound, the more seeds tended to be observed there, however, many observations tended to cluster at zero.

To further investigate, the data was visually (Figure 3) and statistically checked for homoscedasticity and normality. According to the checks, the data was both heteroscedastic and non-normal.

Thus, a Kruskel-Wallis test was run. The Kruskel-Wallis test ......

The effect size indicates that the difference in seed counts between mound locations is significant but small.

**Figure 3.** Diagnostic Plots for Kangaroo Rat Data

The Residual vs Fitted plot checks for constant variance (homoscedasticity) among the residuals. The Scale-Location plot also checks for homoscedasticity, but using the square root of the residuals; both plots show a change in pattern, where points decrease in density from bottom to top, suggesting heteroscedasticity. The Normal Q-Q plot suggests non-normality because of the deviation from the dotted line at the right tail end of the data. The Constant Leverage plot shows outliers in the data, but there do not appear to be any.

```{r}
#Statistical checks
kr_model <- lm(total_seeds ~ loc, data = kangaroo_rat_subset)
check_normality(kr_model) #The data is not normal
check_heteroscedasticity(kr_model) #The data is heteroscedastic

# Results Problem #1

-   low p-value suggests evidence to reject null hypothesis, difference in medians among locations

# Introduction Problem #2

The Niwot Ridge is an alpine ecosystem that consists of cold, snowy, and windy climates and low temperatures during the growing season (Edwards et al., 2007). Despite these conditions, many plants have adapted to this environment.Â  Learning more about these plants can better inform us of plants that live in their climate limits (Germino, 2014). Seed count is the number of seeds produced by a plant that is commonly used to determine the plant's fitness (Wen and Simmons, 2020). Plants have numerous biological and physical factors that can contribute to their seed count. Using data from "Individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge, 2019 - 2021", we will investigate how the seed count of plants in the Niwot Ridge varies with total number of inflorescences, plant species, and plot type. We hypothesize that plant species and number of inflorescences will be the biggest factors in determining seed count.

# Methods Problem #2

There were four datasets the study that they came from, but we only used one of them called seed count weight. We did this because seed count weight contained all of the variables that we were using to compare seed count such as total number of inflorescence, plant species, and plot type. Seaver counted the number of seeds by breaking up dried buds with her fingers and counting all the viable seeds. A seed was "viable" if it had a plump look and feel compared to an aborted seed that was clearly shriveled and small. The seeds were collected from five different species: Geuros, Kobmyo, Carrup, Arefen, and Minobt. Viable seeds were recorded and put into envelopes that had their respective species, plot number, and number of inflorescences collected (Seaver, 2022).

To get a better understanding of the dataset, we ran a series of tests and created visualizations that helped us understand the relationship between variables. As shown in figure 1, there are variables in the dataset that have missing data. However, the number of missing data is not too significant and we still have a large number of observations to work with. We still subsetted the data to drop the missing data. As shown in figure 2, we used the ggpairs function to create plots that we can use to visually assessed the relationships between variables. We found that the number of influoresences and seed count had a strong Pearson's correlation, but there seemed to be no relationship between variables based on visual assessment of the scatter plot and bar graphs. As shown in figure 3, we calculated Pearson's correlation to determine the relationships between numerical values of number of inflorescence and total seed count. We found that there was a strong correlation between number of inflorescnece and total seed count. The Pearson's correlation was a 0.93 which is a considered a strong correlation.

In order for us to determine how seed count varies with plot type, plant species, and total number of inflorescences, we created three models that each had different methods for looking at how the variables effected one another in the model. As shown in figure 4, we visually assessed the normality and homoskestacitiy of residuals using a series of diagnostic plot for the models. We found that the visual assumption check of the plots show that the model do not conform to linearity or normality. Therefore, we did not use linear regression models because the models did not conform to the assumptions of linear regression. Instead, we used generalized linear models with a negative binomial distribution which is why we decided that the model seedctwt3 is the best and most simple model. This is because when we did a summary of the model we used shrub plot to compare against the control (open plot) and found that open plot had higher seed counts than shrub plot. This showed us that there was a still a pattern between these two variables. We also used the MuMin function to determine which model had the lowest AIC score. We found that model seedctwt3 had the lowest AIC score which meant it was best model to use.
